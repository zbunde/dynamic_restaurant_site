    But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or the vindictive
    princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present
    matter of his leg, he took plain practical procedures; he called the carpenter.

  <p>
    And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay set about
    making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and
    joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage,
    in order that a careful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be
    secured. This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night;
    and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the distrusted
    one in use. Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary
    idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to
    proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.
